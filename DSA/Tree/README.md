# Java Programs Documentation

This document provides an overview of three Java programs: Binary Tree Operations, Expression Tree Construction, and Threaded Binary Tree Operations.

## Binary Tree Operations

The Binary Tree Operations program includes functionalities to create a binary search tree (BST) by level, insert new nodes using an array, find the number of nodes on the longest path from the root, find the minimum data value in the tree, swap left and right pointers of each node, search for a value in the tree, and perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

### Usage

To use the Binary Tree Operations program:

1. Compile the Java file containing the classes.
2. Run the `Main` class.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform desired operations on the binary tree.

## Expression Tree Construction

The Expression Tree Construction program constructs an expression tree from a prefix expression and allows postorder traversal of the tree.

### Usage

To use the Expression Tree Construction program:

1. Compile the Java file containing the classes.
2. Run the `ExpressionTree` class.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to enter a prefix expression and perform postorder traversal.

## Threaded Binary Tree Operations

The Threaded Binary Tree Operations program implements functionalities to create a threaded binary tree (TBT) and display the tree using inorder and preorder traversals.

### Usage

To use the Threaded Binary Tree Operations program:

1. Compile the Java file containing the classes.
2. Run the `Threaded` class.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a threaded binary tree and display it using inorder or preorder traversal.
