# Java Programs Documentation

This document provides an overview of two Java programs: one implementing a hashing algorithm and the other performing set operations.

## Hashing Algorithm

The hashing algorithm program consists of classes `HashTable` and `Hashing`. It provides functionality to insert, search, and display elements in a hash table using linear or quadratic probing for collision resolution.

### Implementation

The program contains the following classes:

- `HashTable`: Represents a single entry in the hash table containing an index and a mobile number.
- `Hashing`: Implements the hashing algorithm and provides methods for insertion, searching, and displaying elements.

### Usage

To use the hashing algorithm program:

1. Compile the Java file containing the classes.
2. Run the `Main` class.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform insertion, searching, or display operations.

## Set Operations

The set operations program allows users to perform various operations on two sets, including addition, deletion, display, search, size determination, and set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and subset checking.

### Implementation

The program implements the following functionalities:

- Addition and deletion of elements from sets A and B.
- Displaying elements of sets A and B.
- Searching for elements in sets A and B.
- Determining the size of sets A and B.
- Computing union, intersection, and difference of sets.
- Checking if set A is a subset of set B.

### Usage

To use the set operations program:

1. Compile the Java file containing the program.
2. Run the `SetOperation` class.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform desired set operations.
